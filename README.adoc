= Using asciidoctor-bibtex with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin

This is a minimal example project which demonstrates how to use
asciidoctor-bibtex with the Asciidoctor Maven plugin. The
http://rubygems-proxy.torquebox.org/[TorqueBox RubyGems Maven Proxy
Repository] is used to install the asciidoctor-bibtex gem and its
dependencies in Maven's target directory.

Executing `mvn` will process the Asciidoc example document into HTML and
PDF files in `target/generated-docs`.
